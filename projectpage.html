               This project is a page that I made for a classmate. The purpose of this website is to display her interests for a possible job offering. 
               We had to list there favorite movie, color, what grade they're in, etc.
               I was able to incorporate all her interests on this webpage while adding a twist of my own.

            <p>
                I was assigned to make a presidential campaign site/advertising for a candidate of my choosing. I decided to make one for my puppies Duke and Blaze.
                It's a little skeptical however I promise they make a great argument.

            <p>
                For my financial literary class, the class was assigned to make a powerpoint that would explain their "Dream Vacation" students had to work
                with $3,000 and had to budget for travel, food, hotel, activities, and souvenirs. I decided to code a presentation instead to help practice my coding.

        <a href="https://protest-project.glitch.me/">Protest Finder</a>
            <p>
                For the CodeNation hackathon that took place on the Intrepid, my group decided to make ProtestFinder! ProtestFinder would allow the users to 
                look up protests happening around NYC (which would eventually expand). People would be able to gain points for participating in the protests 
                and would redeem those points for rewards depending on what partnerships existed. The webpage would provide information on ProtestFinder and 
                information on the protest the user is interested in attending.

            <p>
                For a Microsoft Hackathon, my team and I built a wireframe of our idea named SafeFace. SafeFace would be regulated by school guidance counselors
                ensuring a safe community for LGBT+ students to discuss topics and receive advice. The only way a student would be able to access the website is
                if their school's guidance counselor approved them and gave them a code which would allow them to access the webpage and communicate with other users.
                The website would allow them to access free online therapists that they could consult with if necessary. SafeFace would also provide chatrooms for the
                user if they're interested in how to come out, or overcome harassment, etc.

            <p>
                I applied for an Engineering Stem Saturday Class that would take place from 10-4, every Saturday until Decem ber 15th when final presentations would occur.
                Every group was assigned with the task to make a toy for people who lived with disabilities. My group decided to cover the topic of Deafness, we believed
                that it was not discussed enough in society and that there were limited resources to those who dealt with it. We decided to make a 3D hand that would help
                people learn the American Sign Language (ASL). Our hand would shape the letters A, B, D, V, W and I love you. We first tried to make the hand sign the entire
                alphabet however some letters require wrist movement and due to our time constraint, we had to limit ourselves. The hand would form certain letters out of the
                6 options provided (randomly) then choose a button that was the possible right answer. If the answer was right a green light would glow and the sign would change,
                however, if it was wrong a red light would glow and the sign would remain the same until the user got the answer correct.

            <a href="https://bgonzalez127.github.io/playlist/">Playlist Project</a>
            <p>
               For this project, I was required to make a playlist using Jquery, CSS, and HTML. One main component that I used were arrays. This project allows you to see
               which songs I have added and will allow the user to add their own songs as well. One issue that did come up with my project was that the user when inputting
               their song is that the image will not show up nor will the link address fully.

            <p>
                For this project, I was tasked to make a virtual fortune teller that will "predict the future". I had to take the value from 3 input boxes and print them into
                the missing spaces of the body. I used Jquery, CSS, and HTML to complete this project.

            <p>
                For this project, I used Jquery, CSS, and HTML to create a treasure hunt, where the user can choose different answers, and paths to get a specific type of ending.
                A problem that I had with this project was grabbing all the images and placing them in the code in the proper order. Another problem that I had was keeping the 
                code organized. However, despite the challenges, I was able to push through and complete the project.

            <p>
                For this project I was asked to make an award site, that would show nominees and the winners of 4 categories that we made up ourselves. I enjoyed this project 
                a lot because I love working with CSS and designing webpages. I did not have much trouble with this project and am proud of the way it came out.

            <p>
                I used this project during a hackathon, the task was to create a new feature that would add to the JetBlue website. My team had the idea of creating a more interactive experience 
                between the flight attendants and the fliers. It would allow the users to recognize the good work of the users and allow it to be posted on the site so that way all users can see it. 
                We included a fact page in the beginning so that way the users can access the information easier.

            <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/jgarcia672/hackathon_project/homePage.html">Clean and Green</a>
            <p>
                This project was used in the Advanced Class CodeNation Hackathon. We had to focus on how to create a tech tool to help educate people on environmental factors and how to positively
                impact the environment. My group created a website that would help users who wanted to help clean up locations find polluted areas faster. We focused on beaches due to the fact that
                spring break for college students just passed and most of them go to beaches to relax, this, however, causes a huge amount of pollution on the beach. This allowed people to view two
                beaches: Miami Beach and Coney Island, and it would show a Google Map API of the satellite view of the beaches and below would show the current state of the beach. The user would then
                be able to press 2 buttons above the images that would let them sign up to clean the beach that day and the other button would let other users using the page know which part of the beach
                they just cleaned so that way no one wastes time checking an already clean part of the beach. The about page informs the user of what our mission is and so much more! If we had more time
                my group would have added a chat so that way people at the location could discuss meet up times, cleaning, etc. We would also allow users to add places of their own so that way if they
                were on their way to work they could take a picture of a local park, street, etc that was dirty and someone who was free could clean up the area in their free time.
