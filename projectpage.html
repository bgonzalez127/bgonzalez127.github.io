            <p>
               This project is a page that I made for a classmate. The purpose of this website is to display her interests for a possible job offering. 
               We had to list there favorite movie, color, what grade they're in, etc.
               I was able to incorporate all her interests on this webpage while adding a twist of my own.

            <p>
               This page is to display an award ceremony of categories I assigned myself in which I would then choose the best possible candidate out of
               a list of nominies.

            <p>
                I was assigned to make a presidential campaign site/advertising for a candidate of my choosing. I decided to make one for my puppies Duke 
                and Blaze. Its a little skeptical however I promise they make a great argument.

            <p>
                For my financial literary class the class was assigned to make a powerpoint that would explain their "Dream Vacation" students had to work
                with $3,000 and had to budget for travel, food, hotel, activities and souvenirs. I decided to code a presentation instead to help practice
                my coding.

        <a href="https://protest-project.glitch.me/">Protest Finder</a>
            <p>
                For the CodeNation hackathon that took place on the Intrepid, my group decided to make ProtestFinder! ProtestFinder would allow the users
                to look up protests happening around NYC (which would eventually expand). People would be able to gain points for participating in the protests
                and would redeem those points for rewards depending on what partnerships existsed. The webpage would provide information on ProtestFinder and 
                information on the protest the user is interested in attending.

        <a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bONYYv">Safe Face</a>
            <p>
                For a Microsoft Hackathon my team and I built a wireframe of our idea named SafeFace. SafeFace would be regulated by school guidance counselors 
                ensuring a safe community for LGBT+ students to discuss topics and recieve advice. The only way a student would be able to access the website is 
                if their schools guidance counselor aprroved them and gave them a code which would allow them to access the webpage and communicate with other users.
                The website would allow them to access free online therapists that they could consult with if necessary. SafeFace would also provide chatrooms for 
                the user if theyre interested on how to come out, or overcome harrasment, etc.

        <a href="https://cooperteam02.wixsite.com/website">ASL Hand</a>
            <p>
                I applied for an Engineering Stem Saturday Class that would take place from 10-4, every Saturday until Decem ber 15th when final presentations would 
                occur. Every group was assigned with the task to make a toy for people who lived with disabilities. My group decided to cover the topic of Deafness, we 
                believed that it was not discussed enough in society and that there was limited resources to those who dealt with it. We decided to make a 3D hand that
                would help people learn the American Sign Language (ASL). Our hand would shape the letters A, B, D, V, W and I love you. We first tried to make the hand
                sign the entire alphabet however some letters require wrist movement and due to our time constraint we had to limit ourselves. The hand would form certain
                letters out of the 6 options provided (randomly) then choose a button that was the possible right answer. If the answer was right a green light would glow 
                and the sign would change, however if it was wrong a red light would glow and the sign would remain the same until the user got the answer correct.
